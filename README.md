# Py Battle

Wellcome to Py Battle, a text-mode RPG style adventure developed in Python 3.

On this game you're going to face hordes of random creatures and try to kill as many as possible. 

### Motivation
Back in 2005, I was a jrpg fanatic and aspirant game developer, actually, I was coding my own jrpg. 
Well, that didn't go so well, but I ended up having a lot of fun coding those jrpg battle systems. 
What brings me back to the present time, where I was in need to learn python and was after a small project to practice and get used to the syntax. 
Childhood memories kicked in and... _voila_. Here we are :)

### How to play
1. Ensure you have python 3 installed on your machine, you can have the last binaries for your system on the oficial channels or through your system package manager

2. Clone or download the repo:
    ```
    # Clone with https
    git clone https://github.com/edmarsj/pybattle.git

    # Clone with ssh
    git clone git@github.com:edmarsj/pybattle.git
    ```
3. Execute the main script:
    ```
    python3 main.py
    ```
4. Have fun!
5. Contribute!
